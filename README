INFO:
This is a BlackMesa Disaster Recovery system to be used with VMware Data
Recovery Appliances (VMware DARE aka
https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vdr_10_admin.pdf).  The basic idea is to
synchronise DARE exports from one set of appliances to other set of
appliances, wherever they might be.

To do so, we need an inteligent inotify listener and rsync wraper (lsyncd
wasn't exactly what we were looking for) which can handle sparse-file
changes that VMware DARE does and checksums the files before transferring,
to make sure it makes sense to transfer at all (as DARE appliances are
known to change bytes in files but content can remain the same in the
end), including transfer queues with IO throttling.
